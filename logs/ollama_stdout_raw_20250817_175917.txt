Thinking...
We need to write Python code that fetches current top 5 stories from Hacker News API, prints titles and URLs. The HN API: https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/topstories.json returns array of IDs. Then for each ID, fetch item: https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/item/<id>.json returns JSON with title and url. Need top 5. We need to print title and URL. Use requests. Need to be self-contained and runnable. We can include import requests. Maybe handle missing url. Also include main guard.

Also note that some top stories may be missing url? For simplicity, print "No URL" if missing.

Let's produce code. Use requests.get, raise for status. parse JSON. For top 5 IDs, fetch each, then print.

Will the environment have requests? Assume yes. But could use urllib. But requests is more convenient. Provide code accordingly.

Also include minimal error handling.

We output code only. Let's write:

```python
import requests

def main():
    top_url = "https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/topstories.json"
    item_url = "https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/item/{}.json"
    try:
        ids = requests.get(top_url, timeout=10).json()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error fetching top stories: {e}")
        return
    for i, item_id in enumerate(ids[:5], 1):
        try:
            item = requests.get(item_url.format(item_id), timeout=10).json()
            title = item.get("title", "No title")
            url = item.get("url", "No URL")
            print(f"{i}. {title}\n   {url}")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error fetching item {item_id}: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Yes. Ensure code only.
...done thinking.

```python
import requests

def main():
    top_url = "https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/topstories.json"
    item_url = "https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/item/{}.json"
    try:
        ids = requests.get(top_url, timeout=10).json()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error fetching top stories: {e}")
        return
    for i, item_id in enumerate(ids[:5], 1):
        try:
            item = requests.get(item_url.format(item_id), timeout=10).json()
            title = item.get("title", "No title")
            url = item.get("url", "No URL")
            print(f"{i}. {title}\n   {url}")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error fetching item {item_id}: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
